This morning and at school just before class I was able to get most of the sales site working properly.
Today was code review day and it was my turn, it lind of felt like I was the only person in class sitting there without any clothes on, wierd.
According to the class my code looked good, which came as a suprise to me, I spent a lot of time on it but I didn't particularly think it looked good.
I struggled getting everything to work and now I know why, I was trying to do everything using DOM manipulation while I should of used a new method that is strictly for forms.
I'm gald I used my code today, especially since I was able to get the last part of it fixed as a result.
