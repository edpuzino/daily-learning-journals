I got a lot of work done today on my logo and the pictures of my stores, also getting the store pictures and information to the main page.
I feel like i'm finally catching up, I keep wanting to do more and wore to the salmon cookies but I know eventually I have to let it go.
Most everyone was busy doing their own work today, nobody was really looking for much help which was kind of strange.
