I took the forth quiz today, the last question wasn't working for me for a few tries, I finally figured it out, I thought it was looking for the output but it was actually looking for the statemnet to invoke the function.
Today we are supposed to discuss final project ideas, I haven't really thought about this yet nor did I come into class with anything in particular that I really wanted to do with my new coding abilities.
Our reading today was on debugging which I love, the best new tactic that I learned about was breakpoints.
Got wireframe finished in class today, this was a big help, looking at all that is coming up in the near future.
